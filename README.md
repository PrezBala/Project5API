# FlickRater API- Project 5

The objective of this API is to serve as a robust backend mechanism for the Flickrater frontend application. It is specifically designed to facilitate seamless Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations through the user interface. This structure empowers users to interact with the application effectively and efficiently.

FlickRater API is the backend service used by the [Live link to the Repository](https://github.com/PrezBala/Project5FE)

# Development Goals

The objective of this API is to function as a backend service, enabling the FlickRater frontend application to carry out Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations through its user interface.

# Agile Planning

This project was developed following agile principles, with a series of four sprints. Each feature was prioritized and labeled as either "must-have," "should-have," or "could-have." We began by implementing the must-have features, followed by the should-have features, and finally addressed the could-have features if time and resources permitted. This approach ensured the delivery of a comprehensive website, with optional enhancements added based on capacity.

## Epics

The user stories were grouped into different Epics

## Set Up

This epic encompasses the crucial steps to get the Django application and Django REST Framework operational, creating a robust platform to start developing the features.

## Movie Creation

This epic focuses on the establishment of API endpoints and database integrations to support CRUD operations for the creation of movie posts, forming the backbone of movie content in the application.

## Movie Description

This epic is dedicated to designing and implementing API endpoints and database connections for the CRUD operations specifically related to the Movie description field, allowing for detailed storytelling and representation of each movie.

## Custom Auth Token

This epic targets the creation and handling of unique user tokens. It involves designing API endpoints and database interactions for CRUD operations of these tokens, providing a layer of security and personalization for each user in the system.

## Movie Rating

This epic covers the design and development of a comprehensive movie rating system. It includes creating API endpoints and database connections that allow users to rate each movie, offering a user-driven evaluation of each movie listing.
